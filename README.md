# 🧙‍♂️ Wizards vs Orcs

🎮 This is a small 2D shooter game.

## 🧨 How to use

Upon opening the [hosted](https://wizzards-vs-orcs.vercel.app) version, there are three buttons.
1. `Start` will take you to the game - three short levels with a final boss at the end
2. `Compete` will take you to a different scene where you can compete for points.
3. `Stats` will take you to a scene showing the 5 best scores you've achieved
